# testmon's incremental selection is unsafe here: these integration tests share
# DB state (reference-data seeds, ordering) by design, so running a testmon-chosen
# SUBSET deselects the tests that set that state up and the survivors fail
# intermittently. The full parallel run is fast enough to not need testmon.
