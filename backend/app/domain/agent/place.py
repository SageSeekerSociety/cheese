"""Where the platform's own files sit on a machine it borrows.

A room's machine belongs to someone else. Everything the platform installs on
it — the executor and its helpers, the CLI, the environment runner, the launch
scripts, the session homes, the shared package store — goes under one root, so
that removing the platform from a machine is deleting one directory rather than
recalling every path some launcher ever wrote. That root is `footprint_root()`,
directly under the machine owner's own `$HOME`, and it is the whole of what
`cheese uninstall` removes.

Inside a session home there is a second name to read. `.claude` is the root
earlier launchers installed into, and a room does not move: it keeps its
executor, its markers and its helpers where the launcher that prepared it put
them until something prepares it again. Reading only the current root answers
"this room never had an executor" for a room that has one running. So the
current root is what we write, and `session_platform_dirs()` is what we read —
in this order, most recent first.

That pair exists INSIDE A SESSION HOME and nowhere else. On the machine's own
`$HOME` the platform has only ever written `footprint_root()`; the `~/.claude`
beside it is the machine owner's — their Claude Code credentials, their
settings, every transcript they have — and nothing here writes it, moves it or
removes it. An uninstall walks the footprint root and stops.

Five programs cannot ask this module and carry the name themselves: the
environment runner, the cleanup script, the executor bootstrap and the sandbox
CLI (`backend/sandbox/cheese`) all run where nothing of ours is importable — one
is written out beside the room's own files and run as a script, one is piped in
on stdin and has no `__file__` to look at, one is exec'd out of a string, one is
shipped into the agent's container as a standalone program — and the connector
is Go. Their copies are checked against this module by
`backend/tests/unit/test_footprint_root.py`. The value is chosen here and
nowhere else.
